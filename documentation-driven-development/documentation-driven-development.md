# BDD
## Uses examples to deepen understanding

# Ubiquitous language

^We use the language of the business domain and keep implementation detail away from our definition by example.

---

# Continuous conversation

^This conversation is described as input and output. Question and answer from a human perspective. We are driving the understanding of a business domain where the high level consumer of the result is a human being.

---

# What if?

---

## What if the consumer of the consumer of our software is a machine?

^For example an API... Yes this will include business logic and that logic would be defined and model with conventional BDD examples. After all your domain layer is not your API.

---

# Your API is presentation

---

# More Accurately

---

# Your API is a representation

---

# It is implementation detail

^And we keep our examples free from implementation detail, right?

---

# But...

---

## API implementation detail is important!
## Especially to the poor soul who has to integrate with them

---

## Documentation for free..
## Insert quote from Spec and Behat

---

## APIs have lots of important implementation detail

---

## Lots of out of band detail that is actually very important

^Headers, structure, HTTP Satus

---

## Define this with Gherkin?

---

## Use Mink + Goutte?

---

## Anyone done that?

---

# What is the ubiquitous language of an API

---

# HTTP 1.1

---

## HTTP is a text based protocol

^Quote from the RFC
