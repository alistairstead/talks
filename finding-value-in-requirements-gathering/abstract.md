# Finding value in requirements gathering

When initiating a project it is viewed as an opportunity for stakeholders to get features they always wanted but could never have. Technology should be a facilitator of innovation and even inflexible legacy code can be refactored to add features when approached correctly. But wait;

"With great flexibility comes great responsibility."

Of all the factors to balance when defining a project, schedule, budget and scope the most important, impact and business value are often not mentioned. Agile, Craftsmanship and Lean principles help us define projects where the effort is focused on delivering true impact and business value.

Starting an ongoing conversation between the customer and the technical team, using a number of small and simple processes and ceremonies we can help focus the investment and effort on value rather than features.

Start with why! What is the business goal and which actors within a system can impact that goal.

We should build project that will deliver what the end customer needs, ensuring the genuine business objectives are met through measurable and achievable goals.

Following this presentation you will be able to use the processes and ceremonies in your own projects and to identify the appropriate metrics that can be used to track the impact of a technical project. This is not about tracking progress of delivery but the value that the expended effort has brought to the client and where further effort should be targeted.
