# Agile Engineering over Over Engineering

Building Agile engineering teams that make mature smart decisions for complex problems is a fairly common goal. If it were easy, far fewer books would be being sold by Amazon.

When people approach problems they bring with them certain biases to how they view that problem domain. Engineers tend to see every problem as complex. After all complex problems are what we are specially skilled to solve. However, is every element in an engineering project complex?

How can a framework from cognitive science (Cynefin) help teams mature in their thinking and approach to problem solving? Identifying strategies to break down complex problems and to produce clean simple solutions can make Agile teams much more effective.

Although it may sound like common sense using an explicit process can help expose the bias and identify the path to a solution.

You will leave this presentation able to apply the Cynefin framework to technical analysis and have a set of questions you can pose to teams in order for them to make mature choices when approaching problems.
