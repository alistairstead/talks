# Symptoms of low internal software quality

A common problem in software projects is low internal quality. It happens in every team. It's a natural effect of business pressure. However, a high performing team will keep these factors in check through constant improvement.

Having been in this situation before; here are the most common symptoms a team with low internal software quality may show.

## Everything has become harder to complete

Almost every feature or bug fix your team needs to do is hard. It was not always like that. You remember the good old days when your team was fast, and everything ran smoothly.

## Slowing velocity

Your team’s velocity decreased or is decreasing. When you were building the first version of your product, it was fast to develop a new feature, and your team used to complete lots of them every iteration. Now it’s different.

## Slow test suite

Your test suite takes more time to run than before, and you are beginning to question the value of tests. If you have no or limited testing that is an even bigger issue.

## No capacity to improve

You and your team don't have time to implement continuous learning to improve the coding skills.

## Bugs that don’t go away

Your team fixes a bug, then in a week or so it appears again, meaning that your team is creating regression bugs.

## A demotivated team

Your team keeps complaining that working on the project is not as productive as it was in the past. A single person can’t build one feature alone; there are too many moving parts.

## Knowledge silos

There are some parts of the software that only a single developer knows well enough to maintain. It’s difficult for the rest of the team to work with that specific code.

## New developer ramp-up time is taking too long

When new developers join the team, it takes too much time for them to be fully productive.
